    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello there! my name is Yassin Abdulkadir, 
            I live in eastern part of Africa also known as the horn of Africa. 
            And my country is Ethiopia. I am 28 years old and married with beautiful daughters, 
            I have a bachleors degree in International Trade and Economics. How does a guy with 
            buisness degree fell in love with coding you might ask, I would tell you it was 
            an accident that was meant to happen, you see my wife was the one who introduced 
            me in to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My wife was also a buisness major, matter of fact she has a bachleors and masters 
            degree in buisness adminstration and at some point in life she wanted to change a 
            career and that was when she got introduced to coding. You might ask how ? It was a 
            friend from collage who majored in computer science who gave her an idea about coding. 
            He gave her a motivational speech on how anyone can be come a programmer if they took 
            some course on udemy and just put in the work. That worked and she started coding and 
            I saw her typing a bunch of words and symbols then boom some magic happens on the screen. 
            It fasinated me and asked how she did that, and then boom I got hooked! and decided to 
            code for a living and the rest is history! haha.
